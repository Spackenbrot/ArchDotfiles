# ArchDotfiles

for the love of god please don't look into my dotfiles, they are horrible and only for my personal use.
the only reason they are public is because that way I can download them without having to authorize git first ;)

if for some reason you still wanna try them out, feel free to do so, but I don't take responsibility for nothing xd
